    "Fastai.nbdev is a system for exploratory programming using Jupyter notebooks developed by Jeremy Howard and Sylvian Gugger of fastai. It is aimed at helping python developers practice literate programming. Ideally nbdev is used from within a python/linux environment on a local machine, but many machine learning and deep learning practitioners use Google Colaboratory (Colab)  to develop and run their projects taking advantage of Colab's free GPUs and TPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "nbdev works perfectly well with Colab but there are a few quirks and twists to getting the nbdev programming system integrating smoothly with Colab and Google Drive and this is where nbd_colab comes in. This module provides some useful tools for setting up nbdev with Google Colab and Google Drive together with additional documentation for developers to get the most out of using nbdev with Colab. \n",
    "\n",
    "Use of this module assumes the user is familiar with fastai.nbdev, github, Google Colaboratory and Google Drive. Full nbdev documentation and totorial is at https://nbdev.fast.ai/."

    "Normally, when developing using Jupyter we would write project code in a notebook and manage the project from the command line. With Colab as our development environment, we don't have a command line as such, but we can access the operating system and command line from notebook cells using the os module and ! or % prefixes. \n",
    "\n",
    "So it is quite possible to manage an nbdev project entirely from within your development notebooks, but having code for two different purposes - project code and command line code - in the same notebook quickly becomes cumbersome and confusing. An alternative approach is to set up a Colab notebook outside of the project directory to be used exclusively for command line tasks. Such a project managemnt notebook, separate from the project itself, is used for running tests, for Github and nbdev integration, making Pypi releases and anything else you would normally use the command line. \n",
