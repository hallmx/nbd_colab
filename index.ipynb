    "nbdev is a system for exploratory programming using Jupyter notebooks aimed at helping python developers practice truely literate programming. Ideally nbdev is used along with a python/linux environment on a local machine, but many machine learning and deep learning practitioners use GPUs via cloud providers, one of the most popular of which is Google Colaboratory. \n",

An alternative approach is to set up a Colab notebook outside of the project repo to act exclusively as the 'command line'. This notebook is not part of the project itself and instead is used for running tests, for Github and nbdev integration, making Pypi releases and anything else you would normally use the command line for during project development. \n",
