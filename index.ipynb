    "Fastai.nbdev is a system for exploratory programming using Jupyter notebooks developed by Jeremy Howard and Sylvian Gugger of fastai. It is aimed at helping python developers practice literate programming. Ideally nbdev is used from within a python/linux environment on a local machine, but many machine learning and deep learning practitioners use Google Colaboratory (Colab)  to develop and run their projects taking advantage of Colab's free GPUs and TPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "nbdev works perfectly well with Colab but there are a few quirks and twists to getting the nbdev programming system integrating smoothly with Colab and Google Drive and this is where nbd_colab comes in. This module provides some useful tools for setting up nbdev with Google Colab and Google Drive with additional documentation for developers to get the most out of using nbdev with Colab. \n",

    "Normally, when developing using Jupyter notebooks we would write project code in the notebook and manage the project from the command line. Using Colab as our development environment we don't have a command line as such but can of course access the operating system and command line from Jupyter cells using the os module or ! and % prefixes. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is therefore entirely possible to manage an nbdev project from within notebooks you are using for development, but having code for two differet purposes - project code and command line code - in the smae notebook can become confusing and cumbersome quite quickly. An alternative approach is to set up a Colab notebook outside of the project directory to act exclusively as the 'command line' and manage the project from there. Such a project managemnt notebook, separate from the project itself, is used for running tests, for Github and nbdev integration, making Pypi releases and anything else you would normally use the command line. \n",
