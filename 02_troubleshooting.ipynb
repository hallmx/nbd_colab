The same piece of code also causes a `module not found` error when `nbdev_test_nbs` is run during a GitHub push with resultant 'red cross ' on the repo homepage. This occurs because the required Google libraries are not installed on Github. \n",
    "\n",
    "To handle 1. and 2. above, instead of changing the code or test environment, which are otherwise fine, an easier solution is to exclude those cells from testing. Luckily nbdev has a way of doing this - test flags. First define one or more flags in the `tst_flags` setting of `settings.ini`:  like this `tst_flags = test_flag1|test_flag2`, where test_flag can be any name not alraedy used as a flag by nbdev and multiple flags are separated by | . Placing one of these user defined test flags (e.g.' #test_flag1') at the top of a notebook cell causes `nbdev_test_nbs` to ignore that cellwhen runing tests and no exception will be raised. That should get you past these Colab related test edge cases but there's more to test flags so do read up on them in the nbdev docs."
